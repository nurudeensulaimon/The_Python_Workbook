# Write a program that reads a positive integer,n, from the user and then displays 
# the sum of all the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be 
# computed using the formula.

user = int(raw_input('Enter the integer here:'))

total = user*(user+1)/2

print(total)

# Textbook Solution
# Compute the sum of the first n positive integer 
# Read input from the user 
n = input(input("Enter a positive integer:"))

# Compute the sum
sm = n * (n+1) / 2
# Display the result 
print("The sum of the first", n, "positive integer is",sm)
